# Machine-learning-based-attraction-point-placement-method-for-urban-development-planning
The proposed method is designed for sparsely urbanized areas characterized by the presence of buildings, social infrastructure facilities, and road network elements but lacking sufficient points of attraction. Such conditions are typical for territories described in city master plans and urban development strategies, as well as in comprehensive urban redevelopment projects.

The method has practical applications during the pre-project research stage:
1. In residential area planning by development companies;
2. For justifying the placement of commercial facilities by small and medium-sized businesses.

Key features of the method:
1. Compatibility with existing urban planning systems;
2. Adaptability to various design scales;
3. Scientific validity of decision-making.

The core of the method is implemented as an iterative process of service generation through a three-tier system reflecting the hierarchy of spatial planning. Each level corresponds to a specific degree of detail and considers the unique interrelationships between urban environment objects. The proposed method features structural adaptability, allowing for adjustments to the initial selection of analyzed objects based on research objectives. A fundamental requirement for their inclusion in the analysis is the availability of verified data that clearly defines the typological classification of services.

1. High-Level Generation (Macro Scale)
At this stage, broad categories of attraction points (attractors) are generatedâ€”services whose spatial distribution shows significant correlation with the input data. Placement considers proximity to social infrastructure facilities and key transportation nodes.

The generation is based on urban planning standards, demographic projections, and existing development data. The result is a territorial zoning scheme with the distribution of primary functions.

2. Mid-Level Generation (Meso Scale)
This level identifies more detailed relationships between services within designated functional zones. Spatial analysis and machine learning methods are used to determine optimal ratios between different types of facilities.

3. Point-Specific Generation (Micro Scale)
The final stage involves defining specific service types, considering the previously established spatial relationships within the study area.

The tiered structure of the method enables a gradual transition from abstract planning to concrete solutions, minimizing the risk of inefficient space utilization.
